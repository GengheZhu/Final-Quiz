    * By looking at the data we see that Bubble Sort is the least efficient sorting algorithm, 
    * taking the most steps no matter the number of integers. This is because it doesn't adapt to 
    * to previous changes made in the passes. Insertion is the most efficient, because it is 
    * founded on the statement that if a>b and b>c then a>c. Selection is in between because
    * it had to constantly switch the smallest object with an object in the beginning. In general,
    * the more integers being sorted, the more steps are needed to solve it.
