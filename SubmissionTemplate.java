    * Write a 1-2 sentence write-up about your observations.
    * As the number of sorted integers doubles, the number of steps it takes increases by approximately four times (Next#ofSteps = 4 * Previous#ofSteps).
    * Bubble sort takes the most steps while insertion sort takes the least amount of steps.
